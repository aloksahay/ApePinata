### How it works:

ðŸ”· Send 1 $APE to the contract on ApeChain, get assigned a number. You can send up to 1000 $APE per transaction, and you'll get one entry per $APE. No limit on the number of transactions you can send for more entries.
ðŸ”· Once the contract balance hits 100,000 $APE, every new entry will trigger a random draw (powered by 
@PythNetwork
) for a number between 0-1M
ðŸ”· If the number is unassigned, play on
ðŸ”· If the number is yours, the entire contract balance is sent to you
ðŸ”· Once a winner is selected, the tournament resets

But here's the twist:
ApeChain is the home of NFTs, did you think I'd forget about them? There is a small chance (between 0.1% and 1%) that a Shadow NFT holder will get the payout instead.

Send native ApeCoin ON APECHAIN only. Any $ape sent on other chains will be lost.

## [ApePinata](https://x.com/0xQuit/status/1891242962538905932)

### How it works:

ðŸ”· ApePinata is like ApeBomb, but it starts with a target of just 100 $APE, instead of 100,000  
ðŸ”· Every time a winner is selected, the target goes up by 10%   
ðŸ”· Winners get 98% of the pot. 2% feeds upwards, into ApeBomb  
ðŸ”· Every time you send $APE, all of the yield for ApePinata's holdings is redirected towards you (until somebody else sends $APE)
